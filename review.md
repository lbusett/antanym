### Review Comments


### Comments on functions

- `an_read()`

Though I like the solution used by the authors to allow "caching" of the data in a folder
selected by the user (also because the download of the file is quite slow), I think that 
it could be better improved. 
At the moment, the user has to manually specify the folder where the data will be cached. However, 
if in another session he wants to use again the cached data he will have to remember
where exactly he saved it in the first place. I think that a better solution could be to 
use package `rappdirs` so that the data is placed in a "standard" folder (e.g. 
`file.path(user_data_dir(), "antanym")`. 
That way, the user could just use a "flag" argument (e.g., use_cache_dir == TRUE). 
The first time, this would lead to download to a CSV in the "standard" folder. Later
on, the CSV would be automatically found and data loaded from it. 

- `an_read()`

The documentation of the "query" argument could be improved. It is mentioned that 
it should be a "regular expression". From the implementation, however, it appears
that the user is supposed to provide a string containing space or comma-separated "words"
to search. For example, 

`query = "Mount, Boots"`

resolves in search terms "Mount" AND "Boots"
